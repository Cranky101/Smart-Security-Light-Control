# 🌟 Smart Security & Light Control System

## 📌 Project Aim
Design and simulate a smart home automation system that:
- 🕵️ Detects human movement (PIR sensor)
- 🌙 Monitors ambient light (LDR sensor)
- 💡 Automatically controls lighting (LED)
- ☁️ Sends real-time alerts to Adafruit IO (MQTT, Wi-Fi)

---

## 📝 Problem Statement
Modern smart homes need efficient, automated systems for:
- Security (motion detection in dark)
- Energy saving (lights only when needed)
- Real-time cloud alerts
